# osu-replay-resampler

This program resamples your (osu) videos using different algorithms featuring ffmpeg.
The currently implemented algorithms are tblend (blends frames over; not recommended) and tmix (recommended).

Supported file formats are .mp4, .avi, .mov, .mkv and .flv but mp4 is recommended.

# Not maintained

This project is not actively maintained and developed. It is a free-time project I program on when I have time and feel like continuing.
There are some things that could make the program not work for you.
Furthermore, no support is likely to be given. 

But feel free to submit issues if you found a bug or you need help, I may take a look at it!
